    "In Python, everything is an object. All classes, including the `BaseException` class, ultimately inherit from the `object` class, which is the root of Python's class hierarchy. This inheritance chain forms the basis of the object-oriented paradigm in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inheritance chain typically looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **object** (the root of Python's class hierarchy)\n",
    "  - **BaseException** (the root of Python's exception hierarchy)\n",
    "    - **Exception** (a subclass of `BaseException`)\n",
    "      - Various built-in exceptions (e.g., `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we say that `BaseException` is a child class of `object`, it means that `BaseException` inherits from `object`. In practical terms, this inheritance implies that the methods and properties defined in the `object` class are available to all classes in Python, including the `BaseException` class and its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this inheritance relationship helps in comprehending the fundamental concepts of Python's object-oriented programming model and how exceptions are structured within this framework. It also means that exception classes, like any other Python class, can exhibit behavior inherited from the `object` class.\n",

    "`SystemExit` and `GeneratorExit` are both exceptions in Python that are used for specific purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`SystemExit`**:\n",
    "   - `SystemExit` is an exception raised by the `sys.exit()` function.\n",
    "   - It's used to request the Python interpreter to exit.\n",
    "   - When this exception is raised and not caught by an exception handler, it usually results in the termination of the program.\n",
    "   - It's a subclass of `BaseException` and directly inherits from it.\n",
    "   - Typically, `sys.exit()` is used to cleanly exit the program or signal the interpreter to exit with a specified exit code.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",

    "    sys.exit(0)  # Exiting the program with exit code 0\n",
    "except SystemExit:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`GeneratorExit`**:\n",
    "   - `GeneratorExit` is an exception that is raised inside a generator function when the generator is closed using its `close()` method.\n",
    "   - It's raised to perform cleanup operations or release resources when the generator is explicitly closed.\n",
    "   - This exception is raised by the Python interpreter itself when `close()` is called on a generator.\n",

    "Example of `GeneratorExit`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",

    "        yield 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Both `SystemExit` and `GeneratorExit` are subclasses of `BaseException`.
