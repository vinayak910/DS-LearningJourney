Linear regression
------------------


- Linear regression is supervised machine learning algorithm
- it is used to solve regression problems
- regression problems - whose output column will be numerical 





types of linear regression
---------------------------

1. simple lr :  

- 1 input , 1 output
- ex : input col : cgpa , output : Package 
- based on cgpa , you will predict the package , this is simple linear regression 

2. Multiple lr: 

- if more than 1 input columns , then multiple lr 
ex : predict package based on cgpa and experience


3. Polynomial lr : 

- when data is not linear

Simple Linear Regression
-------------------------

ex : you have cgpa data and package data . what if there was not data  , then the alternative would be avg package 
- but that is not a good choice , as it will vary

- but we have the data
- what we can do is plot the data , scatter plot of cgpa and package.
- you will find your data sort of linear.





ques:  why data is sort of linear , why not perfectly linear?

- because this is the real world data , and there are various factors that may also contribute in deciding the package . Ex : good interview
- these factors are generally called stotastic errors ie which cannot be determine 


ques : what if data will be perfectly linear?

- we can simply draw the straight line but for that we need eq of line y = mx + b , where m is slope and b is the intercept)
- if we know the slope and intercept , we know the equation of line , hence line can be drawn .
- now for each x value (cgpa) , there will be y value(package)



ques : But our data is not perfectly linear . What can we do?

- the answer is you will still draw the line , but line will be best fitted .
- best fitted means : that line will closely pass through the all data 
- thats what is linear regression



Final Definition (intution)
---------------------------

- linear regression is the supervised machine learning algorithm used to solve regression problems
- in this , first you check the data we have is sort of linear or not . 
- if it is sort of linear  , you will pass a best fit line . (you have to find that values of m and b , which will make the minimum error ie pass closely through all the data)

- package = m*cgpa + b



human interpretion of m and b
--------------------------------

1. m 

- weightage ie (cgpa ke upar kitna how much depend krta hai package , vo number m hai )
- if m value is low , then package would not too much depend on cgpa
- if m value is high , then it means package will be highly dependble on cgpa



2. b

- b is the offset ie even if the cgpa become 0 , then there would still be value left for determining the package
