How to find value of m and b?
--------------------------------



2 ways
-------

1. Closed form solution 

- anything that has a mathematical formula is closed form solution 
- in this you dont do any differentiation or integration 

- in linear regression the closed form solution is OLS method (Ordinary leasts square)


2. Non closed form solution 

- in this you used approaximation techniques such as differentiation and intergration to find the value 
- in linear regression  ,you can use gradient descent




ques if there is a direct formula (OLS) why would we use approaximation techniques?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- when you work with higher dimension (more number of input columns ) , it is difficult to use the direct formula , hence in higher dimension approaximation techqniues such as gradient descent is used .






OLS
-----


- as it is closed form solution , hence you have formulas for finding the values of m and b 

- refer to register to see the formulas for m and b and their proof
- refer to jupyter to see code from scratch for OLS
