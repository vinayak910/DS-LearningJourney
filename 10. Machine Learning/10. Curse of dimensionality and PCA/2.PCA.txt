PCA
----

- unsupervised machine learning model
- complex
- introduced in 1950
- complex maths




Intro
======

- feature extraction technique 
- reduce the curse of dimensionality


Understanding through analogy
------------------------------

-  Photograph taking match of soccer. 
- The soccer match is actually happening in 3d environment(stadium)
- But photos are in 2d. 
- that's what PCA do . 

- PCA brings down higher dimension data to lower dimension without losing the essence of data which was in higher dimension . 


Benefits of PCA
-----------------
1. since the size of dimensions is reduce , now the ml model will run faster on data. 

2. performance will be same even in lower dimension

3. Visualization : Since you can bring higher dimension data to lower dimension such as in 1d 2d 3d , IN these dimensions you can visualize the data. 



Feature selection tip : 
------------------------

1. Problem
- When there are two input features ie no of rooms and no of grocery stores and you have to perform features selection. 
- plot no of rooms and grocery store. Whosever spread is more will be selected.


2. Problem
- lets change the features ie no of rooms , no of bathrooms. Now if you look at spread , the spread will be almost equal. and you cannot perform feature selection. 

- IN this situation you cannot perform feature selection .In this you can perform feature extraction.


 
How feature extraction solves the 2nd problem?
----------------------------------------------

- Lets take a same example. 
- where input col are no of rooms and washrooms. 
- if you ask real estate agent , he has domain knowledge . he will suggest that instead of two columns make it 1 column ie size of room.
- the 2d data is brought down to 1d ie size of the room
- the size of room will contain both info room and washrooms. 
- This is what pca does.

PCA - forgets its existing features. Instead it makes new set of features and from that new set of features it chooses the subset which is most important. 


Gemoetric intution
-------------------
- Shift the coordinate system , you will get new set of axis. 
- The new axises will be called Principle components. 
- ON Whichever principle components the spread is more . 
- you will select that components and apply some transformation acc to thier principle components. 
 
To understand bettrt , refer to geometric intution in the register. 



What is variance ? 
- refer to statistic session
- Note : Variance is not exactly spread , but proportional to spread
- ques : Why not Mean absolute deviation?
- ans : Because , mod is not differentiable at zero.
