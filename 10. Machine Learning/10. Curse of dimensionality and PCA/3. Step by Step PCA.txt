You have 3 features f1 , f2 , f3

Step 1 : Mean centering of data.
Step 2 : Covariance matrix  -> [3 X 3]
Step 3 : Find eigen vector and value for covariance matrix. 
 
- In step 3 , there you will get 3 eigen vectos and eigen values. The vector will highest eigen value becomes Principle component 1 , the eigen vector with second highest eigen value will become principle component 2, and third eigen vector will become principle component 3. 

- Its upto you , how many principle components you want to select.
