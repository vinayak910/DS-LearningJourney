Stratified k fold
-----------------

as i mentioned in the previous text file , the problem with using normal variant of k fold for imbalanced dataset can be bad . As it can leads to overestimation of performance . because in certain folds it may contain the data of only one class ,or very less occurrence of other class . In such case the model will biased towards the most occurred class and will mostly give output of high occurred class . which leads to high accuracy and same goes for other folds. which increase in overall avg of accuracy . But this avg accuracy will be wrong interpreted . because the data was imbalanced .


so the solution is stratified k fold .

it makes sure that in each folds , each folds will have almost same ratio of data. benefit : There will be no case in which only 1 class is present in a fold which avoids the problem of 100% accuracy . E
