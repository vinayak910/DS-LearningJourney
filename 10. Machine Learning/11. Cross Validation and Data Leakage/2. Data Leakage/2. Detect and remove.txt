Detecting Data Leakage
=======================

1. Review your features : 
-------------------------
- review all your input features at the start. 
- check if there are any features that would not be available while prediction 

2. Unexpectedly High Performance 
--------------------------------
If model performance on validation set is surprisingly good  there this could be a sign of data leakage. Because most predicting tasks are challenging and exceptionally high performance could mean that your model has access to information it shouldn't

3. Inconsistence Performance Between Training and unseen data :
---------------------------------------------------------------
deploying the model and got to know that model performance is poor , it indicates there might be data leakage while building the model . 

4. Model interpretability : 
---------------------------- 
interpretable models or techniques like feature importance can help understand what the model is learning , if the model places too much importance on a feature that doesn't seem directly related to the output , it could be sign of data leakage. 



Remove Data leakage
===================

1. Understand the data and task 
--------------------------------

2. Careful feature selection : 
-------------------------------
Review all features .make sure the features are genuinely correlated to target column , not a copy or something which directly explains the target column 
3.  Proper Data Splitting : 
---------------------------- 
do splitting before preprocessing

4. use of pipeline in cross validation 
---------------------------------------
- idea is to first perform folds , then perform preprocessing steps using pipeline . by using pipeline you can perform separate preprocessing on training folds and test folds which avoids data leakage. 

5. Remove duplicate data
---------------------------
as duplicate data introduces data leakage.
