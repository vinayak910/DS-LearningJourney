Logistic Regression
-------------------

- It is the classification problem even though its name is regression 
- it comes under the linear model family which means : 
- It is applied on data which is linear , then it performs good as a line can separate the two classes 
- ex : cgpa , iq  placement 
- It works not well on non linear data , ex : concentric circles , in this you cant make line to separate 2 classes
