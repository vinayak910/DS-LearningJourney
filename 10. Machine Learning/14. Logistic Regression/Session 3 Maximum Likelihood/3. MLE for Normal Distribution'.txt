IN the previous txt , we studied what is maximum likelihood , 
- our example was we have a normal distribution with mean of 150 , and std = 10. 
- We randomly select a person of age 100 , now the likelihood for person of age = 100 , belongs /follows the normal distribution of mean = 150 and std = 10 is :

	likelihood = L(mean = 150 , std = 10 | x = 100) = small no 

- that means the likelihood of person of age = 100 belongs the normal distribution of mean = 150 and std = 10 is very low. 


Maximum Likelihood says we have a data x = 100 ,  find the parameters value for normal distribution i.e. mean , std for which our likelihood of x = 100 is maximum 

We have observed data that belongs from particular distribution now our work is to find value of parameter for which likelihood is maximum

- and in our case the parameter of distribution is mean = 100 , in this distribution the likelihood of person of age 100 belongs to this particular normal distribution is maximum 



This was the topic from last txt



- As we noticed , we found the parameters for only single value(x = 100) , But in real we have a column of data , that contains multiple age values.
- 61 , 32 , 45 , 63 ...............89 
- we know that data follows normal distribution , by using kde plots , qq plots etc. 
- But we dont know which normal distribution it follows , it may follow a normal distribution of mean = 50 , std = 2 , or it may follow normal distribution of mean = 60 , std = 3 or any other . we dont know these values. 
- and how to find these parameters? -> we will use MLE
- Based on this data , we will find such values for mean and std for which our maximum likelihood is maximum .


= L(u , std | x1 , x2 , x3......... xn)

let's start with random value of mean and std 

1) mean = 100 , std = 10 
 - L(u = 100, std = 10 | x1 = 61 , x2 = 32 , x3......... xn = 89)
 -  we will have some prob value from this , let's say it : 
 -  = 0.89
 
2) mean = 110 , std = 20

 - L(u = 110, std = 20 | x1 = 61 , x2 = 32 , x3......... xn = 89) 
 - = 0.79
 
- Similarly we will try for other values of mean and std
- we will select that mean and std for which our this likelihood value will be maximum 
- This is the strategy we will follow. 


Now , how to calculate this L(u , std | x1 , x2 , x3......... xn) ? 

To make it simple , let's assume there is only x1 . We know how to calculate it -> Using pdf of normal distribution 

- L(u , std | x1) =   (1/root(2*pie*std^2))*e^(-(x1 - u)^2)/2std^2

- Similarly we will assume there is only x2 , and will do the same for others

- Now here we will take assumptions i.e. these x1 , x2 .......xn are independent events. Therefore all the individual likelihood will be multiplied = Overall likelihood 
- but we know due to multiplication it would cause underflow , hence we will take log
