- In linear regression there should be linear relation bw x and y , and if the relation is not linear , we can use polynomial regression 

- Same concept will be applied in logistic regression 

- Logistic regression does classification by fitting a line on linearly separable classes .

- what if the classes are not linearly separable ? -> refer to jupyter notebook image 

- good part is it is also linear model , you can also create non linear decision boundaries with the help of polynomial features 


- applying this on x column with degree 2 
- x will be converted into x0 , x1 , x2 
- now we have 3 input columns , now we will have 4 parameters -> B0 , B1 , B2 , B3

- But for non linear data classification other algos performs better 

- refer to jupyter notebook
