- Finding the coef values ie B0 , B1 , B2 , doesnt mean they will be useful all the time , as if the data was non linear then these values will not be useful.

- Blindly finding out the coef is not linear regression 

- you also understand the relationship between X and y using stats and this process of studying the realtionship is called regression analysis.


- we need to analyse the value of m and b.


Regression Analysis
--------------------

- use to examine the relation between one dependent variable(target/y)  and one or more independent variables(input).

- goal : 

1. understand how dependent variable changes when one or more independent variable is altered
2. create a model that predict the value of dependent variable 




Flow for linear regression
---------------------------

1. define the research question 

- you want to know the relation between the columns , or use the input column to predict the target column .


2. Collect and prepare data

3. Visualize the data

4. Check Assumptions 

5. Fit linear regression model 

6. Interpret the model :
 
- this is where regression analysis comes in .  
- check how much useful the values of coef are .
- analyse the estimated regression coeffs, thier standard errors , t - values , p - values and much more
- refer to pdf


7. Validate the model 

8. Report results




ques arises
------------

q1. What is statistics connection?


Why ML problems are Statistical inference problem?
---------------------------------------------------

Statistical inference - you have sample and using sample your estimate the parameters of population

- Similary you have a tabular data of 100 students of cgpa, iq , lpa that can be called as sample
- and you are trying to find mathematical equation which will tell the lpa of all students(population) 

- therefore lpa = f(cgpa , iq) .

- if lets say you find the mathematical equation , that means you are kinfd of god. Because using mathematical equation you are simpling predicting the lpa for all students.

- but that is not correct. 

- As there are hidden/real world factors which cannot be count as input and influence the value of lpa.

- ex : lpa is more , because the interviewer is his senior . Lpa is less because interviewee was not well.

- These are called errors , as they cannot be governed by mathematical equation

- so the new equation will be -> lpa = f(cgpa , iq) + E

- where E is the error we talked about , it is generally called irreducable error. They cannot be governed by mathematical equation.

- since E cannot be governed , we focus on f(cgpa , iq). WE use 2 types of algo to find fn. 


1. Parametric 
- assumes the nature of function
- ex Linear regression is a parametric algo , which assumes the function f(cgpa , iq ) will be linear ie -> B0 + B1cgpa + B2iq
- Now our work is to find the parameters not the function


2. Non parametric

- do not take any assumption about the function
- it makes the function from scratch






Parametric
-----------

ex linear regression

assumes linear and True equation for population is 

lpa = B0 + B1cgpa + B2iq

this is the true equation .

But when you applied linear regression , you get these coef -> b1,b2 ,b0. which will not be exactly equal to B0 , B1 , B2.

 
Why not equal 
----
- because the linear regression is applied on 100 students and you are making prediction based on that 100 students data(sample). and if next time you applied on different data , the coef will be again different.

- therefore the coef you calculated will be different from population coef.
  
- the function you get is f'() , and the true function is f() . 
- there is also one more error which is f() - f'() (True function - your function) . it is called reducable error.

- it is called reducible , because there is possiblity of making your function better , hence the error can be reduced.

so if you want to predict , the true function will be 


lpa = f'(cgpa , iq) + reducible_error + E

- so our work is to reduce the reducible error
- f'() is estimated relationship of x and y based on given data 
- f() is true relation between X and y for population 


refer to jupyter notebook to see practical


conclusion : Basically the prediction you do is based on sample , but the true relationship is based on population . SO to estimate how much close we are to the population , we use different statistical tools such as confidence intervals , central limit theorm , testing etc


 so this ques What is statistics connection? is answered.

q2 Why is regression analysis required?


Inference Vs Prediction (Why regression analysis is required?)


Prediction 
------------

- you have a data you used ml model , the output you have is prediction


Inference
-----------

in inference , you study how there is a relation between input and target. 
ie knowing the internal working . And the study you do is inference. That's why you need regression analysis.


concept of black box model
---------------------------

you have input and you get the output from the model you dont know the internal working . In this interpretation is hard or close to impossible .




Conclusion
-------------

Machine learning is not only used prediction , but also about inference.
that is where regression analysis is required (for inference)


NOTE : generally a model that is good in inference , they are weak in prediction and vice versa. Trade off between inference and prediction .

linear regression is one of those algo which are good in inference , hence regression analysis is required
