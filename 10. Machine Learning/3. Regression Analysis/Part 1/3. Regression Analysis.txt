There are 4 sections in Regression analysis
1. Tells about the data we have
2. goodness of fit (study the relation between x and y)
3. Coef
4. Assumptions




Relation between x and y
--------------------------

- F statistic and Prob(F statistic) tells if there is a relation between x and y
- In this you do a test called F -test for overall significance (closely related to anova)

-  the test result will tell if there is a relation bw x and y.




Concepts required for doing F -test
-------------------------------------

1. Tss , Rss , Ess and df



Tss : Total sum of squared
Rss : Residual sum of squared 
Ess : Explained sum of square

refer to register



2. Degree of Freedom(df_total)



 Degree of freedom(df_total) = n - 1
 df_total represents overall variability in the dataset


How?

the df_total in linear regression is divided into 2 components

1. df for model(k) : No of input columns 
2. df for residual : No of data points - (number of parameters including intercept) -> n - (k + 1)   where K+ 1 is no of parameters(coef and intercept) and n is number of rows

the total df is :

df_total = df_model + df_residual

df_total = k + n - (k + 1)
df_total  = n - 1 

this is the mathematical formulation for degree of freedom


Intution of degree of freedom for residual (n + (k - 1)
-------------------------------------------

setup 1 : 1 input , 1 output .

- ques can linear regression be fitted with one point?
ans : No . 

- ques : can linear regression be fitted with 2 points
ans : still no , because it exactly passed through those points. Therefore it cant explain the variabilty. As it cant move after passing through 2 points

Therefore , regression line required minimum three points to explain the variabilty of dataset and the third point allow the line to move freely. Thats where the concept of independent comes.


Therefore , in this case degree of freedom will be 1. as 1 point is allowing regression line to move freely.

mathematical ans : n - (k + 1) = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1
where k is no input col and n is number of points



lets say there are 5 points , then degree of freedom will be 

n - (k + 1) =>   5 - (1 +1) = 3. 
therefore 3 points are allowing line to explain variability



if 200 points -> 200 - 1 - 1 = 198




Setup 2 : no of  input columns = 2 , 1 output

In this , plan will be fitted , the question is how much minimum points are required to explain the variability of dataset

= n - (k + 1)
= n - (2 + 1)
n - 3. 

if n = 3 , then no variability. But if n = 4 , 4 - 3 = 1 . 1 is the first degree of freedom. Therefore minimum 4 points are required for plain to explain variabilty of dataset.

Therefore df residual is freedom to move. A way to introduce variability.



F - test for overall significance
---------------------------------

The F-test for overall significance is a statistical test used to determine whether a linear regression model is statistically significant, meaning it provides a better fit to the data than just using the mean of the dependent variable. 

- means whether our model is good or not. what if our model error is more than mean error . ie there is no contribution of independent variable in predicting target variable.
