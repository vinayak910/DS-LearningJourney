Feature selection
------------------

you use subset of features from given features for prediction



Why need of feature selection?
-------------------------------


3 main reasons

1. Curse of dimensionality(features)

- With certain no of features, we get the optimum result.
- if we add more features , it may hinder the performance

Why it is not good to add more features?
ans : 
- Sparcity : as you increase dimensions. The distance between points will increase and and distance will not be reliable 
- example : distance between 2 points in 100 dimension will be more than 2 points in 2 dimension


2. Computation Complexity

- more time and space complexity , due to high no of features.


3. Interpretability 

- If there are high number of features , it is difficult to inference. ie studying about the input and output columns
- If making model for inference , then one would prefer the low dimension data .



Types of feature selection

1. Filter based technique
2. wrapper methods
3. Embedded techniques
