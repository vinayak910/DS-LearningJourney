Elastic net : Combination of ridge and lasso
-------------------------------
situations where you should use elastic net : 
1. let's say you have a data with high number of columns , and you dont know whether to use ridge or lasso. 

2. When input columns have multicollinearity.

in such case , you can apply elastic net . 

In elastic net , you add both type of penalties ie square of slopes and modulus of slope . 

L =  mse + alpha*w^2  + beta*|w|

In sklearn , you have two main hyperparameter :

1. lamda which is alpha + beta. By default the value of lamda is 1 , ie means alpha = 0.5 and beta = 0.5. This means you are equally applying l1 and l2

2. l1_ratio : a/a+b 

- if you set l1_ratio to 0.9 , it means you are applying 90% lasso and
