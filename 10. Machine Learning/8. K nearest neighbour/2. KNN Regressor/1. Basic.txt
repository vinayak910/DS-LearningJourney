Every step is same as KNN , the difference is instead of Majority rule , you find the avg of nearest neighbors.

Ex : CGPA iq package


- we got query with cgpa and package value , we find query distance from each training data point . we sort it , we decide k no of nearest neighbors 

- the avg of k nearest neighbors will be the predicted value.
