Overfitting 
-------------
- for a low value of k , the knn will ovefit
- lets say you decide k = 1 , so the predicted salary will be same as your one nearest neighbor. 
- - the regression curve will be pointy. 
- so due to this , model will learn too much about the training data.
- hence there will e high variance , if you change the data little bit , the model will perform bad -> overfitting.






Underfitting 
--------------


- for very high value of k , the knn will underfit.
- as you increase k , the regression curve will smooth out. ie not pointy.
