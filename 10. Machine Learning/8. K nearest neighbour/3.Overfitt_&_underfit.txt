Overfitting
--------------

- For low value of K , the model may underfit . As knn is trying to learn even minor minor changes in the training data. 
- the decision boundary would not be smooth . Not clear partition will be there.



Underfitting
-------------

For large value of k , the model may underfit. In which knn didnt try to understand training data , and knn just directly giving results.



- That's why choosing the optimum k value is must.
