tell if thiis statement is True or False? 

***Mlops is a set of principle to deploy machine learning models into the production***

ans : this statement is false

Mlops is much more thant that



definition
------------
- MLOps refers to practice and discipline with machine learning that aims to unify and streamline the machine learning system development (dev) and machine learning system operations(Ops).
- it involves collaboration between data scientists , ML engineers , and It professionals to automate and optimize the end to end life cycle of machine learning applications






Mlops components
-----------------

1. Data management : Making a dataware house from database using etl

2. Version control : multiple people will be working on making a model , so changes reflect to each other . Need of version control

3. Automation (Pipeline) : many steps in making ml model -> preprocessing , feature engineering , eval . These whole series of steps can be automated using pipelines

4. Experiment Tracking : carefully track different experiments on model building 

5. CI/CD : the experiment whose results were promising CI is done . ie integrating with website in such a way model and website should both be working fine. 
Once it is integrated and test , then you will deploy on production (CD)

6. Monitoring/Retraining : check/monitor if model performance is degraded due to different drifts and if does we will trigger the experiment tracking step and again this cicd process will be done.

7. Provisioning : different requirements , infrastructure comes under provisioning

8. Governance : carefully quality checks , kya andar jara hai aur kya bahar jara hai. You dont fall into legal problems



Key aspect
-----------

being a data scientist just by model building it doesnt mean it will help 1cr users . You need a ml system to help at such large scale with proper steps.
thats where mlops comes.
