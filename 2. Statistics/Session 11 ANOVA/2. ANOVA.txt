ANOVA
-------


- Two types of test

1. One way anova
2. two way anova






One way ANOVA Test 
-------------------

- it is used to compare means of more than 2 groups 
- it is called one way anova there is only one independent factor/variable with multiple groups
ex: Avg age of male , female , other gender. IN these there are three groups. 
     gender : one independent variable with multiple groups
	

- this test is similar to two sample t test , the diff is . In 2 sample T test , you compare mean of two independent groups , IN one way anova you compare mean of multiple groups




Steps for One way Anova
------------------------

refer to register for test and geometric intution


Assumptions
------------

1. Independence: The observations within and between groups should be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one observation should not influence the outcome of another. Independence is typically achieved through random sampling or random assignment of subjects to groups.

2. Normality: The data within each group should be approximately normally distributed. While one-way ANOVA is considered to be robust to moderate violations of normality, severe deviations may affect the accuracy of the test results. If normality is in doubt, nonparametric alternatives like the Shapiro-wilk test can be considered.

3. Homogeneity of variances: The variances of the populations from which the samples are drawn should be equal, or at least approximately so. This assumption is known as homoscedasticity. If the variances are substantially different, the accuracy of the test results may be compromised. Levene's test or Bartlett's test can be used to assess the homogeneity of variances. If this assumption is violated, alternative tests such as Welch's ANOVA can be used

Post hoc test
------------
- if null hypothesis is rejected ie means atleast one of the mean is significantly different.
- to determine hich specific groups or pairs of groups have significantly different means.
- post hoc test is performed



Post hoc types
----------------


1. Bonferroni correction

- in this you perform independent t test on each combination of two.

example : A , B , C

T test on different combinations
a) A , B -> p value -0.005
b) B , C -> p value - 0.004
c) A , C -> P value - 0.4

you will find the culprit , whose p value is very small. you can see in less p values B is common . Hence b is the culprit. ie means b have significantly different mean.

But performing this , the type 1 error rate will increase. 
- therefore you will divide the p values by no of categories. in our case which is 3. That's why it is called Bonferroni correction.




2. Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test

it is also same. You just need to use library. But is more powerful and provide more information

refer to jupyter notebook






Why t - test is not used for 3 and more categories?
----------------------------------------------------

1. Increased type 1 error
2. Difficulty in interpreting results - as you need to applied t - test on all combinations
3. Ineffciency.



Applications in machine learning
--------------------------------

1. Hyperparameter tuning
2. Feature selection
3. Algorithm comparison
4. Model stability assessment.
