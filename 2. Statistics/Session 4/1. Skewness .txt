Skewness
<-------->

- it indicates that data is not symmetrical 
- measure of asymmetry of probability distribution 
- in skewed data , there will be one tail longer than other 

In any symmetrical distribution, regardless of whether it follows a normal distribution or some other type of distribution, the mean, median, and mode will be equal.


Different Skewness values
<------------------------->
positive : longer tail on right side /right skewed
negative : longer tail on left side  /left skewed
zero : perfect symmetrical distribution 


Tail Event
<---------->

- outlier
- IN finance ,probabilty of this event happening is very low , but when it occurs , it comes with great profit




Central Tendency in different cases of skewness
<----------------------------------------------->

- refer to pdf for better understanding 

1. Right skewed : Mean>Median>Mode
2. Left skewed : Mean<Median<Mode
3. Symmetical : Mean = median = mode


NOTE : 
- If the data looks like normal and have a skew between -0.5 to 0.5 , then for practical purpose we can assume normal distribution

- if beween 1 and -1 . then moderate normal

- if higher then -1 or 1 , then not
