Kurtosis
<-------->

- 4th statistical moment

(1st: mean , 2nd: std , 3rd: skewness , 4th: Kurtosis)

- it tells the measureness of tailness.
- basically it tells how fatter the tail is .
- which means it tells the intensity/frequency of values present at tail.



False Notation about kurtosis
<---------------------------->

- it is false interpretation that kurtosis is a measureness of peakedness , instead it is a measureness of fatness of the tail



Practical use
<------------->
- in finance , there is a study of kurtosis risk



Excess Kurtosis 
<---------------->

- is measure of how fatter the tail of distribution is comapared to normal distribution

- normal distribution kurtosis is 0

- excess kurtosis formula =  sample krutosis - 3


its types
<--------->

1. Leptokurtic

- if sample kurtosis - 3 >0 (+ve) then it is a leptokurtic

- this distribution has fatter tails 
- which indicates that there are more outliers or extreme values in the distribution




2. Platykurtic

- distribution with negative excess krutosis ie sample kurtosis - 3 < 0

- this distribution has thinner tails then of normal distribution tails means there are fewer extreme value




3. Mesokurtic

- distribution with the excess kurtosis = 0
