How to find if a given distribution is normal or not?

1. Visual inspection : Histogram or density plot 
2. QQ Plot : Quantile Quantile Plot
3. Statistical Tests





QQ PLots
<-------->

- used to compare the similarity of 2 sets of distrbutions.
- particular useful for determining whether  set of data follows normal distribution

[X , Y]

- X and Y are the 2 distributions , where Y is a theoritical distribution(We already know the type of distribution. IN our case : Y is the normal distribution), and X is our data 

- if X is Comparable to Y then it is a normal distribution 



Steps

1. Pick a theoritical data Ex : Normal Distribution
2. Sort our data and find its quantiles 1st percentile , 2nd percentile ..............100th percentile
3. Do the same thing for normal distribution
4. Now you have the quantiles for both  , and plot the scatter plot of X distribution quantiles and Y distribution Quantiles .
5. If the points form a straight line or somewhat similar to straight line  , then you can say X is normally distribution or sort of.
