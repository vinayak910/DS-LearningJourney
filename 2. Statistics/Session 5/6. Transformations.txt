Transformations
<--------------->

- if our data is normal , then it is good both for statisticians as we already know more about this distribution and Machine learning because some algo performs better when feeded normal distribution 

- but real world data would not be normal but would be kind of , similar to normal
- so transformations are way to convert the avaialable normal like data to close to normal distribution using some mathematical formula

in this , we will learn Log Normal transformation , Box Cox


sklearn have different transformations 
<-------------------------------------->

1. Function Transformers : which includes log transform , resciprocal , square ,  sqrt , custom
2. Power Transformers : Box cox , Yeo Johnson 
3. Quantile : will not study

FUNCTION TRANSFORMER
<-------------------->

1. Log Transform
<------------->

- applied when data is right skewed
- log doesnt work on negative values 
- what log transform transform do is it brought down the values to equalivalent scale .

to know the more about log transform refer to this chat : https://chat.openai.com/share/40281c2e-00b9-4d64-b3c4-b2ac61f10610


2. Reciprocal 
<---------->
- 1/x
- small values become large
- large values become small
- in some cases this transformation can make our data similar to normal


3. square (x^2)
<------------>
- used for left skewed data 



4. sqrt
<----->
- not used much 

But the goal is to apply different transformation , and choose the one that gives better result




- refer to jupyter to see all these transformations 




============================================================================================================================================================


POWER TRANSFORMER
<----------------->

1. BOX COX TRANSFORMATION

- 2 computer scientist surname
- applicable on numbers greater than 0
- lambda (/\) range to -5 to 5
- lambda can be calculated using 2 techniques 1. Maximum Likelihood , 2. Bayesian Statistics.







2. Yeo Johnson Transform

- variation of box cox
- benefit - work on values less than 0 and equal to zero


refer to jupyter notebook
