**Some recap**


Parameter vs Statistic
-----------------------

Parameter 

- numerical value that describes the characterstics of population such as mean , std of population(pop mean , pop std)
- difficult to obtain data of entire population . hence these values are unknown and is estimated based on sample data

Statistic

- numerical value that describes the characterstics of sample such as mean and std of sample(sample mean , sample std)
- using this values you can estimate about parameters





Point Estimate
----------------

- single value calculated from sample that serves as best guess or approax for unknown population parameter
- Problem is point estimates are not reliable
- ex : Asking dhoni run in next match. Point estimate chances are way too less , so having interval would be more better.
- So rather than point estimate , what if we provide range in which our population parameter will exists , this range is called Confidence interval 



Confidence Interval
--------------------
- is a range of values within which we expect particular population parameter  , like a mean .
- its a way to express uncertainity around estimate obtained from sample data
- now with confidence interval , there is one more thing which we talk about is Confidence level


Confidence Level
---------------
- usually expressed as percentage like 95% indicates how sure we are that the value lies within the interval 
- ex : we are 95% sure that mean of population will lie in this interval [30 , 35]

Confidence interval = Point estimate +/- Margin of error

ex : let say point estimate is 20 , and margin of error is 2. Then interval will be [18 , 22]. and there will be confidence level too.





Ways to calculate CI
----------------------

1. Z procedure : applied when population std is known 
2. T procedure : applied when population std is unknown 




============================================================================================================================================================





Z - Procedure (used less , as generally population std is unknown )
---------------

Assumptions:

1. random sampling 
2. Known population std
3. Z-procedure assumes underlying population distribution is normal. However , if the population distribution is not normal , Central Limit theorm can be applied. Considering sample size>=30



Problem statement:
-------------------

Campusx youtube channel subscribers : 77k , find the avg age of these 77k . Calculate confidence interval with the confidence of 95%.
given : population std = 15 , pop distribution is normal and random sampling 



formula for calculating confidence interval using Z - procedure
----------------------------------------------------------------

=> CI = point estimate +- (Margin of error)

=> point estimate +- [Z(alpha/2) * (population std/root(n))] (refer to pdf file)

here ,  point estimate = x bar(sample mean) , 1 - alpha = 95% , n = sample size  


 (refer to register to know the intution and How to calculate Z(alpha/2) value 





Interpreting Confidence Interval
---------------------------------


1. Interpretation

campusx youtube subscribers 77k 
- lets say we have a confidence interval of [14 - 42] with confidence level of 95% 

wrong interpretation : the probability of my subscriber avg age between 14 to 42 is 95%


right interpretation : if we made 100 times random sample from 77k subscribers , then 95 times out of 100 times the avg age will fall in the range of [14 - 42]

2. Interval range : 

if the confidence level is higher then the interval range will also be more
if confidence level is low , then the interval range will be less
if we are 100 percent confident , then interval range from -infinity to infinity

example 
we will be 95% sure that dhoni will make the run between 20 to 80
but we will be less sure lets say 30 percent sure that dhoni will make 80 to 90 





Factors affecting margin of error (CI = point estimate +- (Margin of error))
----------------------------------

1. Confidence level (1 - alpha)

- if confidence level is more lets say 95% then the margin error will be more too.
- if confidence level is less lets asy 30 then the margin error will be low 

2. Population std 

- high std  => high margin of error
- low std => low margin of error 

3. sample size

- inversely proportianal
- more sample size , less margin of error









============================================================================================================================================================


T Procedure (when std in unknown . Used more as generally both pop parameters are unknown)
------------

- used when std in unknown . Used more as generally both pop parameters are unknown
- also used when sample size is low(<30)



Assumptions of T procedure
---------------------------

1. Random sampling
2. 
3. Approaximately normal distribution (if not then can apply CLT)
4. Independent observations (if not then not proper results)




Formula for t procedure
-------------------------

- in this we dont have a population std , so why dont we replace it with sample std

CI = point estimate +- (Z(alpha/2)* sample_std/root(n))

but it comes with one problem

ie When you will convert the samples into standard normal variate it didnt stay normal distribution , instead it became some other distribution known as strudent T distribution . 

- it didnt stay normal because we are want to calculate pop mean based on sample mean (which vary from sample to sample) therefore uncertain , now we include other uncertain quantity ie sample std (which also varies from sample to sample)

proof : formula for for standard normal variate will be 

refer to pdf file 


Student T distribution 
-----------------------

- Unlike normal , it is a theoritical distribution . Doesnt exist in real life
- this was made to handle the uncertainity we were getting , due to the fact that data didnt remain normal 



Parameters of T distribution
---------------------------
- it has only one parameter ie Degree of freedom
- degree of freedom = n - 1 , where n is the sample size


diff between Normal and Student t distribution
------------------------------------------------

- tail is more fatter , outliers are more 
- as you increase degree of freedom (more samples ) , the t distribution will look like normal . 


NOTE : Since we are not using Z distribution , we will not use Z table instead we will use T table
