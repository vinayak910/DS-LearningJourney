Why?
------
Example - nitish sir avg duration of watch time is 6 min , he wants to increase this avg time , after researching he got to know that these famouse youtubers use normal board whereas nitish sir uses Digital tools. So to know that the normal board method actually will have a more acg watch time or not , he made a one video using normal board method , and the avg watch time on that video was 12 min ,. Now the ques is that will that be sufficient to prove the second method is actually better , maybe the reason for increased time for that particular video maybe sir was looking more handsome , or the topic was trending. So this will not be sufficient. So what he did is he made 4 more videos with the famous method . Now duration lets say was 8 , 9 , 7 , 5 , 12. Now the ques is will that be sufficient to prove? the ans is still no. That's where hypothesis testing comes.


Hypothesis Testing
-------------------

- statistical inference used to decide whether the data at hand sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis

- in our case we had the data of 8 , 9 , 7 , 5 , 12 . So will it be enought to support that hypothesis ie hypothesis was :  using normal board will give more avg view time(population mean) than using digital board


==============================================================================================================================================================

   What part
------------



- Hypothesis testing contains multiple steps 
- 1st step is to choose a null hypothesis
- basically you choose a statement /hypothesis. Ex : in youtube we wanted to know if new teaching style can give more avg view duration .
- Now to test this  , i will choose null hypothesis : which will say new technique doesnt have any effect on avg view duration 

- now there is a second thing which is called alternative hypothesis : statement which contradicts the null hypothesis and claims there is a significant effect .

- now these 2 things cant be happen at the same time .
- so after test either null hypothesis will be right or Alternative hypothesis

- so we gather the evidence/data and  try to reject null hypothesis , if we reject 
it automatically means alternative is correct. rather than proving altenative we try to reject null hypothesis



1. Null hypothesis
-------------------

- statement that assumes there is no significant effect .
- the value is still same as before .

2. Alternative Hypothesis
--------------------------

- statement that assumes there is a significant effect.
- the value has changed 



Important Points
------------------


- so we try to reject null hypothesis , if we reject 
it automatically means alternative is correct. rather than proving altenative we try to reject null hypothesis

- lets say we fail to reject null hypothesis , that doesn't mean null hypothesis was true , maybe there wasnt enough evidence to support alternative hypothesis






the youtube example in Hypothesis testing : 


1. Null Hypothesis -> H0 : u = 6 min ( avg view duration is same as before)
2. Alternative Hypothesis -> H1 : u > 6 min (avg view duration is increased)

   How
----------

Two techniques of hypothesis testing 
-------------------------------------

1. Rejection Region Approach
2. P value approach
