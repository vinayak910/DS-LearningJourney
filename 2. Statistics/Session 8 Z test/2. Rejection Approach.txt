Steps For Rejection approach
-----------------------------

- contains 8 steps( Consdering the youtube example)

============================================================================================================================================================







step 1 : formulate null and Alternate hypothesis
------------------------------------------------

null hypothesis ->  H0: u = 6 min    (null hypothesis says avg view duration is 6 min which is same as before even after adopting new technique )

Alternative Hypothesis ->  H1 : u >6min  (alternative says avg view duration is more than 6 min after adopting new technique)




Step 2 : Select a significance level (Generally 0.05/5% or 0.01/1% is used)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- significance level : It is the probability of rejecting null hypothesis when it is actually true

- meaning significant level ka ye hai agr aap 100 bar test perform kr rhe ho , although null hypothesis 5 baar ya 1 bar true tha , but still apne use 5 baar , ya 1 bar reject kr dia




Step 3 : Check assumptions (example distribution)
--------------------------------------------------

- check data distribution , parameters(population std hai ya nhi), type of data  , working with single column or multiple , based on these assumptions we decide which test to perform in next step




Step 4: Decide which test is appropriate(Z-test, T-test, Chi-square test, ANOVA)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



Step 5 : State the relevant test statistic
--------------------------------------------

- Z - test ka statistic is Z - score , T-test ka statistic is T-score , based on these values we decide whether to reject or not reject null hypothesis




Step 6 :  Conduct the test
----------------------------




Step 7 :  Reject or not reject the Null Hypothesis
----------------------------------------------------

- Z - test ka statistic is Z - score , T-test ka statistic is T-score , based on these values we decide whether to reject or not reject null hypothesis



Step 8 : Interpret the results
--------------------------------

Rejection region 
------------------

- used in hypothesis testing to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not


What happen if we increase alpha value too much?

- if we increase alpha value the rejection region will increase . and if the rejection region increase excessively , then it will result in type error. 
ie rejecting null hypothesis when it was actually true.

- Hence there is standardized value for alpha generally 0.05 or 0.01 . Or it is decided by domain expert 






Problem With rejection region
-------------------------------

- 1st problem :  lets say z value calculated is 1.97 , and the critical point is 1.96 , now you see after the critical point there is rejection region . abd we got the z value = 1.97 . Since it comes under rejection region you reject the null hypothesis . But as you see there is just difference of 0.01 but it comes under the rejection region. so you reject the H0. This is not good

- 2nd Problem : critical value = 1.96 , lets one time z value was 2.00 you reject the H0. And lets say one time z value was 30 . You still reject the H0.
for rejection region they both are same .
In short , rejection approach isn't able to tell the strength of evidence. How strong our evidence is to reject the null hypothesis.



Hence introduction of new approach ie P - value approach , where we calculate additional thing that is p-value which is able to tell the strength of evidence against null hypothesis.

Type 1 error VS type 2 error
-------------------------------

In hypothesis , there can be two results

1. Reject null hypothesis
2. Not rejecting null hypothesis


But in these results there is chance of 2 errors:

1. Rejecting null hypothesis , when it was actually true   -> Type 1 Error
2. Not rejecting null hypothesis , when it was actually false -> Type 2 Error



Type 1 Error (False Positive)
--------------------------------
- error occurs when sample results lead to the rejection of Null Hypothesis when it was actually true.

Ex : 
H0 : No crime 
H1 : Crime 

and the hypothesis result was we had strong evidence against null hypothesis . There H1 was the result. But in reality he did not do any crime . 
Hence even though , Null hypothesis was right , we still reject it . this is called type 1 error or False Positive

So choosing appropriate significance level / alpha is crucial . As if alpha value is increased too much , then there are high chances of False positives.
mtlb agar alpha value faltu me zada le lia , to chances bad jayenge ki usne crime kia hai , even though usne nhi kia.

- Probability of commited Type 1 error is denoted by alpha






Type 2 Error ( False negative)
--------------------------------

- error occures when sample results lead to not rejection null hypothesis , when null hypothesis was false . 
ex  : 
H0 : No crime 
H1 : Crime 

hypothesis result was we didnt have strong evidence against nulll hypothesis . therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis . But in reailty the H0 event was not true . Even though crime kia hai but prove nhi kr paye . 

- Probability of commited Type 2 error is denoted by Beta

If we decrease alpha too much . THe probability of rejecting the null hypothesis will decrease , which can create high chances of False negatives error.

One sided Vs Two sided 
-----------------------


1. One sided test

- WHen researcher wants to know effect in specific direction (> or <)

2. Two sided test : 

- When researcheser wants to know effec in both directions 



Advantages of Two sided test
----------------------------

1. Detects effect in both direction 
2. reduces the risk of Type 1 error



Disadvantages of Two sided test
--------------------------------

1. Less powerful , As alpha is divided at both sides. SO you need more proof to reject the null hypothesis
2. Not appropriate for directional hypothesis 




Advantages of 1 sided test : 
-----------------------------

1. More powerful : as alpha isnt divided , therefore it has more power to find the problem and reject the null hypothesis
2. Directional Hypothesis 


Disadvantage of 1 sided test:
------------------------------

1. Missed effect as we aer focusing on one direction , what if new technique reduces the avg view duration , but hypothesis testing will result in nomal 
2. Increased Type 1 error

Hyothesis Testing ML applications
-----------------------------------

1. Model comparison : used to check which model will perform best on population data 
2. Feature Selection
3. Hyper parameter tuning : comparing model performance with different hyper parameters 
4. Assessing Model assumptions : some ML models follow assumptions , now using hypothesis testing one can assess if the assumptions are met or not
