P value
---------

P - value is the probability of getting sample more extreme ( Strong evidence against null hypothesis ) than our own sample given the null Hypothesis is True.


Understanding through experiment
---------------------------------

Tell if the coin is fair , or coin is rigged ie P(H) > p(T)


H0 : P(H) = P(T)
H1 : P(H)>P(T)


- Toss a coin 100 times (will make binomial distribution . refer to pdf file)
- lets say we got head 53 times . Hence therefore Probability is 0.07.
- Now based on Single experiment we cannot reject the null hypothesis 
- now read the definition again of P value
- our sample is where 53 heads comes
- hmare sample se zada head aane ka probabilty is P value P(H>53) . Region after 53 is P value.

- Interpretation : if head comes greater than 53 , then hum aur zada against hai against Null Hypothesis , as null hypothesis was P (H) = P(T) , but agar head or zada ara hai , lets say 60 , 68 , 70 . Than means hum or against hai Null Hypothesis ke

- IN our case head came 53 times , therefore p Value = P(H>53) ==> P(H = 54) + P(H = 55) + P(H = 56)............. refer to graph


understanding interpretation through tool 
--------------------------------------------

Ex 1 : 

input no of heads = 53 ,
output :  P value = 0.3086

interpretation - If you do this experiment 100 times , and P value is 0.3 , then it means out of these 100 times 30 times 53 aa skta hai 


Ex 2 : 

input no of heads = 60
output : P value = 0.02

interpretation : If you do this exp 100 times ,and P value is 0.02 , then it means out of these 100 times 2 times 60 aa skta hai


Ex 3 : 
input head = 80 
output : P value = 0

interpretation  :if you do this exp 100 times and P value is 0.000001 , out of 100 times 0 times 80 will appear. That means ye event is too much unlikely and agar ye event hora hai coin ke saath , then coin is rigged.






When to reject null hypothesis 
--------------------------------

1. With significance level 

- generally significance level/alpha value is 0.05 or 0.01 
- if P value < = alpha , then we can reject the null hypothesis

Ex1 :  P value 0.02 when head is 60 times , since 0.02 < 0.01 (P value<=alpha) we can reject the null hypothesis
ex2 : P value 0.30 when head is 53 times , since 0.30 >0.01 (P value> alpha ) we cannot reject the null hypothesis


2. In some cases you wont have significance level(alpha) then you can use these rule of thum

- very small If p value<0.01 -> strong evidence against null hypothesis. hence can be rejected
- small if 0.01<=p value<0.05 -> moderate evidence , can still reject.
- Large , if 0.01<p value<=0.05 -> weak evidence , more investigation
- Very large if p >=0.02, weak or no evidence against null hypothesis , hence cant be rejected 


Conlusion : By using P value approach you can actually measure the strength of an evidence

P value in context of z test 
------------------------------


Q1 Suppose a company is evaluating the impact of a new training program on the productivity of its employees. The 
company has data on the average productivity of its employees before implementing the training program. The 
average productivity was 50 units per day. After implementing the training program, the company measures the 
productivity of a random sample of 30 employees. The sample has an average productivity of 53 units per day and 
the pop std is 4. The company wants to know if the new training program has significantly increased productivity.


q2 Suppose a snack food company claims that their Lays wafer packets contain an average weight of 50 grams per 
packet. To verify this claim, a consumer watchdog organization decides to test a random sample of Lays wafer 
packets. The organization wants to determine whether the actual average weight differs significantly from the 
claimed 50 grams. The organization collects a random sample of 40 Lays wafer packets and measures their 
weights. They find that the sample has an average weight of 49 grams, with a pop standard deviation of 5 
grams

T - Test
-----------

- statistical test used to compare the means of two samples or to compare mean of sample to population mean

- used when population std is not available 
- also performs good , when sample size is small 



Types of T - Test
-----------------

1. one sample t -test 
---------------------

- compare the mean of sample to known population mean
- null hypothesis says no difference between sample mean and population mean 
- Alternateive hypothesis says there is difference between sample mean an known population mean 

assumptions : 

- Normality - Population from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed , even if the sample is normally distributed we can say population is normally distributed

- Independence - the value of observation should not influence each other

- random sampling

- Unknown population std 

refer to register and jupyter 







2. Independent Two sample test
----------------------------------

- used to compare mean of two independent samples 
- lets say two classes sec A and sec B , then drawing samples  from sec a and sec b and caculuating their mean and giving hypothesis that sec a avg marks are better than avg marks of sec b 
- Null Hypothesis says no different between avg of thier marks
- Alternative hypothesis says there is a difference between the avg of marks


assumptions : 

- Independence
- normality
- Equal variances


Ex in titanic data there is a hypthesis ie avg age of male > avg age of female 


3. Paired T test (dependent Two sample test )
----------------------------------------------

- used to compare means of tow samples that are dependent or paired 
- Ex : test marks before training and test marks after training (notice that sample are same , only difference is before and after)


Assumptions:

- Paired Observations : the set of sample must be related in some way . Example marks of student before extra classes and after extra classes . In this students are related ie it is in both set of samples

- Normality : difference between two set of samples must be normallly distributed

- independence of pairs : outcome of one pair should not affect the other.



NOTE - if samples are less than 30 then we have to perform normality test and if sample are >30 , then CLT will automatically handle it.
