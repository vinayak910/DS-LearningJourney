api is just a pipeline between 2 softwares 
ex - bulb changing color based on the likes of your photo in facebook
- basically whenever someone like the photo bulb will change its color , here fb is providing its api fb api , by which it is sharing its like data .
ex - booking a seat 7 in train through makemytrip , now that seat will be display booked in other platforms too like bigo or other .
ques > how is it happening?
since irtc is the application which is sharing its api to different applications such as bigo , makemytrip etc. irtc 



technicall definition - api is just a function just like in python. how is it diff?
its a function on a server , since it is on server it will have some url , ex is_even function on server having url - '/is_even' provide input to function using get post then return some output , but that output will be in json format , why json ?



 it will be understandable by every language. lets say some other application come ex makemytrip , lets say this application is written by java , it will understood by makemytrip because its in json format and its understood by every language
