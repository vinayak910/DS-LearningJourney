-----------Funda-----------

SO funda is this , we hve database available in aws now what we will do is we will fetch that data locally and apply some transformation , then upload that data into another data base

- this is called ETL pipeline
- Where fetching is called Extract , applying transformation on data is called Transform and uploading that data into another data base is called load.


--------Plan-----------
- company wants to make a dream 11 predictor
- data science team demands the data in a particular format ie columns - matchid player dream11points
- and that data will be stored in another database of aws and data science team will work on that data
- now the dream11pts will be calculated based on the rules described in their website


--------Concept----------
OLTP - Online transactional Processing(normal database) (running data base) the app communicate with db on daily bases
- fb,insta, swiggy all have OLTP
- Generally it is preffered for data analytics to not to work on OLTP
- So what we do is we make OLAP from OLTP
- OLAP separate database which is used by data analytics team
- So after this we can conclude that the database which is on aws is OLTP , now after fetching and transforming and storing in another database . that database is called OLAP which will be used by data analytics or data science team
- This whole process is called ETL.

----------Some other pts----------
OLTP is called database
OLAP is called Data warehosue , it is also a database but special type of database
